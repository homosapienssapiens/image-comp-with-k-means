# image-comp-with-k-means
An exercise for image compression using kmeans with and without PCA applyed to the pixel data.
---
## Introduction
The following project contains a notebook with two different image compression algorythm versions using a clustering technique named k-means. The first version has a simple k-means algorythm. The second contains the same algorythm but using pca in the pixel array before the k-means algorythm.

## The files
This repository consists of the notebook with the scripts and a folder with the generated images. The images are 3 images per technique (8, 64 and 512 clusters).
